# Deep-Learning-CNN-Analysis
This repository contains 3 sections of CNN, Convolutional Neural Network, analysis that I have sold my soul to do. It is also my first public repository so don't be mad at a cat üê±. Tyty

### Some credits
Le thank you Kenny for some ideas on autoencoder and also introducing attention based CNNs. I literally gave Kenny credits during my interview its pretty pog. If you dont like Kenny you are not pog.

Most of the code for my advanced models are referenced off the original torchvision model zoo library [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/torchvision), they are cool I guess. Not as cool as cat lovers though.
